# Snapchat Camera Roll Stealth Filter

Snapchat Lens Studio allows developers to "Build, Preview, and Distribute AR" experiences to Snapchat users.

I have identified a bug that allows users to take advantage of the 'Preview' function, allowing them to send items from their camera roll without displaying any type of filter to the recipient.
