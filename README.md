# Snapchat Camera Roll Stealth Filter

Snapchat Lens Studio allows developers to **Build, Preview, and Distribute AR** experiences to Snapchat users.

I have identified a bug that allows users to take advantage of the 'Preview' function, sending items from their device's camera roll without displaying any type of filter to the recipient.

## üìñ Extended Description

Snapchat's Lens Studio enables creators to design and test augmented reality (AR) lenses. One of its core functions is allowing paired mobile devices to preview lenses directly within the Snapchat app. 

During exploration, a security oversight was discovered that lets users send content from their **local camera roll** using the lens preview system, without any visible AR filter or watermark, effectively **spoofing the origin** of the content.

This works by:
- Extracting the `serial_uuid` from system memory using Process Hacker.
- Exploiting the authenticated session between Lens Studio and Snapchat's mobile app.
- Using a custom Python script to mimic a legitimate lens preview request.

This bypass affects how Snapchat handles session previews and content authentication, opening the door to potentially misleading use of shared media.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Use this tool responsibly. Misuse may violate Snapchat‚Äôs terms of service and lead to permanent bans. This project is intended for research and awareness only.

   </p>

7. Press **Filter**, choose **Contains (case insensitive)**, and enter `serial_uuid`. Then press **OK**:

   <p align="center">

   </p>

9. Paste the copied content into a text editor and extract the `serial_uuid` value:

   <p align="center">
     <img src="https://github.com/reidanb/Snapchat-Camera-Roll-Stealth-Filter/raw/main/docs/extract_uuid.jpg" width="600" height="150">
   </p>

   Add this value to `config.py`:

   </p>

10. Run the Python script. If all is well, the lens will be sent to your phone:

## üì° Overview - Snapchat API

Snapchat‚Äôs API for Lens Studio relies on a structured flow that authenticates user sessions and links the desktop editor to the mobile Snapchat app. When a lens is previewed, a token (`serial_uuid`) is passed to validate the user‚Äôs session. This preview functionality assumes a trusted environment but lacks robust validation on the origin of the media being sent.

This diagram demonstrates the flow:

</p>

### Key Points:
- Lens Studio generates a preview token tied to the session (`serial_uuid`).
- The mobile app accepts this token and prepares a lens preview environment.
- By injecting custom media and skipping watermark/AR checks, the lens preview becomes a **delivery channel** for unfiltered media.

This method exposes a security gap in how Snapchat verifies preview content integrity.
